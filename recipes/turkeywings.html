    <p>
      Southern turkey wings are a delicious and hearty dish that is perfect for
      a comforting meal. These turkey wings are typically slow-cooked with a
      blend of flavorful spices and seasonings, resulting in tender, juicy meat
      that falls right off the bone. This dish is popular in the southern United
      States and is often served with traditional sides like collard greens, mac
      and cheese, or cornbread.

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika,
        thyme, rosemary, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Rinse the turkey wings and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
      <li>
        Rub the spice blend onto the turkey wings, making sure to coat them
        evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat.
        Once hot, add the turkey wings and sear them for about 3-4 minutes on
        each side, until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the chicken broth into the skillet and bring it to a simmer.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet with a lid or aluminum foil and transfer it to the
        oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the turkey wings for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and
        easily falls off the bone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the oven and pour the barbecue sauce over the
        turkey wings, making sure to coat them evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the skillet to the oven and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes,
        until the barbecue sauce has caramelized and formed a sticky glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the turkey wings hot, garnished with chopped fresh herbs or sliced
        green onions, alongside your favorite southern sides. Enjoy!
