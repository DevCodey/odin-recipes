    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).
        Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions until al
        dente. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and
        whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture turns golden
        brown and forms a paste (roux).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly, ensuring there are
        no lumps. Continue cooking and whisking until the mixture thickens,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low and add the shredded cheddar, mozzarella, and
        American cheeses to the saucepan. Stir until the cheeses have melted and
        the sauce is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, cayenne pepper (if
        using), salt, and pepper to the cheese sauce. Adjust the seasonings to
        your taste preference.

        the macaroni is coated.

        Pour the mac and cheese mixture into the greased baking dish, spreading
        it out evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        If desired, sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top of the mac and cheese to
        create a crispy crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden
        brown and the edges are bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with
        chopped fresh parsley.
