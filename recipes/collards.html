    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds collard greens, stems removed and leaves chopped</li>
      <li>6 slices of bacon, turkey bacon, or 2 smoked ham hocks</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a hint of heat)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (optional, for tanginess)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon, turkey bacon, or ham hocks
        over medium heat until browned and crispy. If using ham hocks, allow
        them to render their flavorful fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cooked meat from the pot and set it aside. If using bacon or
        turkey bacon, leave a small amount of fat in the pot for added flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut√© until
        the onions become translucent and fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the collard greens to the pot, stirring to combine them with the
        onion and garlic mixture. The greens will begin to wilt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the chicken broth, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and red
        pepper flakes (if using). Stir well to incorporate the seasonings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the cooked meat (bacon, turkey bacon, or ham hocks) to the pot,
        nestling it among the collard greens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot,
        and let the collard greens cook for about 1 to 2 hours, or until they
        are tender and flavorful. Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using ham hocks, remove them from the pot and shred the meat. Discard
        any bones, fat, or skin. Return the shredded meat to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the seasoning to your taste preference. If desired, add apple
        cider vinegar for a tangy note.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer the collard greens for an additional 10 minutes to allow the
        flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the collard greens hot, along with their delicious meaty
        accompaniment. Pair them with cornbread, rice, or your preferred
        Southern side dishes for a truly satisfying meal.
